# Workflow Coding Tool

This utility has been created by member of the SEAL group at University of Zurich, when we had the need to validate our results of an open-coding session. Participants had to describe their workflow when working on several programming scenarios. The *workflow sorting* tool had supported us while agreeing on a set of activity labels, while modeling the individual descriptions, and -ultimately- it provided the required infrastructure to compute the reliability of our rating.

## Usage
